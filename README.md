# GAMSA

GAMSA (Genetic Algorithm MSA) is a student project which tries to implement multiple sequence alignment algorithm using genetic algorithm techniques. The main sources used were the following two papers:

- [A simple genetic algorithm for multiple sequence alignment](http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2007/vol4-6/pdf/Xm0016.pdf)
- [Multiple Sequence Alignment Using a Genetic Algorithm and GLOCSA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234831605_Multiple_Sequence_Alignment_Using_a_Genetic_Algorithm_and_GLOCSA)

The final approach of GAMSA is a combination of the best ideas in the aforementioned papers.
